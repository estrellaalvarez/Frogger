# FROGGER
## Project Description
Browser based clone of 1981 arcade game Frogger. The object of the game is to place the frog in one of the three 'home' spaces across the hazardous river within the 30-second curfew. This frog's got some **strict** parents! 

I Illustrated this entire game myself *except* for the body of the frog, which was borrowed from [Pixelart's](https://www.pixilart.com/) stamp tool.

## Getting Started- # Take a *leap* and see if you can make it home on time!
